Coding Exercise: Time Converter

In Java, you have been given a partially implemented TimeConverter class that aims to convert time from hours or days
to minutes. 
The TimeConverter class has two static methods that need to be completed:

convertHoursToMinutes(int hours): This method should take an integer value representing hours and return the equivalent 
value in minutes.

convertDaysToMinutes(int days): This method should take an integer value representing days and return the equivalent
value in minutes.

Instructions

Task 1: Complete the convertHoursToMinutes method in the TimeConverter class so that it accurately converts hours 
into minutes. The method should return an integer value representing the total number of minutes.

Task 2: Complete the convertDaysToMinutes method in the TimeConverter class so that it accurately converts days into 
minutes. The method should return an integer value representing the total number of minutes.

NOTE: Return -1 for invalid cases (days and hours less than 0).

step1:
hours<0
 return -1
 
step2:
convertHoursToMinutes--
    hours*60
    5*60--300minutes
    
convertDaysToMinutes--
    day*24*60
    2*24*60
    120*24
    ----------
    480
   240
  ---------
   2800
